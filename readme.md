# LyricCounter

This project allows a user to enter a musical artist and
will then return the average word count of all their songs

Built using Python, it makes use of the 'requests' library
to make HTTP requests to *Musicranx*, an API that
specialises in returning information and metadata about
musical artists and their releases.
